###Installation

This is still in early development phase. You'll be informed how to install this, as soon as possible.

###What this is

Let's make error handling a bit smarter. overflow.js displays the as-correct-marked answer of the first stackoverflow question it can find, concerning your unhandled ecxeption. Let's be honest, what would we be without stackoverflow.com
