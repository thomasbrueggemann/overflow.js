overflow.js
===========

##What this is

We spend most of the time debugging applications by researching the internet and, let's be honest, what would we be without stackoverflow.com.

Let's make error handling a bit smarter. overflow.js displays you the as-correct-marked answer of the first stackoverflow question it can find, concerning your unhandled ecxeption.

This can help you in a lot of cases to trackdown your bugs more easily.

##What this is not

Seriously, this is not going to change the way you debug applications in total, but it might give you a quick hint where to look at, in case you stumble upon a nifty exception.

It helped me and I am happy, if that counts for anything ;-)
