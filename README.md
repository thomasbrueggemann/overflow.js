###What this is

Let's make error handling a bit smarter. overflow.js displays the as-correct-marked answer of the first stackoverflow question it can find, concerning your unhandled ecxeption. Let's be honest, what would we be without stackoverflow.com

This can help you in a lot of cases to trackdown your bugs more easily.
